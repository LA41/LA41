Hi, I’m @LA41!

Since I started coding I'm honestly mesmerized by computer science. I caught fire when found Harvard CS50 lectured by David J. Malan. Currently I take mentioned course and Java Masterclass by Tim Buchalka, also supplement my knowledge in a field of data structures, algorithms and relational databases.

I am looking for an Java-related internship - might be unpaid, since right now the most important things for me are growth, learning and gaining experience. If you find my Github projects interesting, you can reach me on:
- LinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/in/luadam97/
- mail: lu.adamczyk97@gmail.com
- phone number: +48 721 344 950

Fun fact: When I was 10 years old I saw a frog with a crown on its head. However - my parents (and everyone else) refused to believe me.
